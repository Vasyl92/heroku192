1) <b>rails generate controller pages views index about info contact</b><br>
2) <b>root :to => 'pages#index' видалити index.html</b><br>
3) <b>match '/about', :to =>'pages#about'</b><br>
4) <b>match '/info', :to =>'pages#info'</b>
   <b>match '/contact', :to =>'pages#contact'</b><br>
5) <b>link_to "About", about_path </b>

7) This will render a file named _menu.html.erb at that point within the view being rendered. Note the leading underscore character: partials are named with a leading underscore to distinguish them from regular views, even though they are referred to without the underscore. This holds true even when you're pulling in a partial from another folder:
<b>render "menu"</b>
